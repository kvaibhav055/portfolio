            <p>Welcome to My Cybersecurity & Development Portfolio!</p>
            <p>Hi, I’m Vaibhav Sharma, a cybersecurity enthusiast and full-stack developer with a strong foundation in C++ and web security. My passion lies in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and secure web development, ensuring that digital platforms are resilient against modern cyber threats.</p>
            <p>I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology at Manipal University Jaipur (2022-2026). My technical journey is fueled by an insatiable curiosity to analyze, defend, and fortify applications against vulnerabilities. I specialize in network security, encryption, and secure coding practices, constantly exploring emerging cybersecurity trends and frameworks.</p>
            <p>Beyond development, I actively engage in CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions, bug bounty programs, and cybersecurity research. I contribute to open-source security projects on GitHub and refine my problem-solving skills on GeeksForGeeks and other competitive programming platforms.</p>
            <p>My projects focus on secure application development, including penetration testing tools, encrypted communication platforms, and hardened web applications that align with industry security standards.</p>
            <p>I invite you to explore my work, and if you're passionate about cybersecurity or interested in collaboration, feel free to connect!</p>
